# U.S. Adult Females With Any Disability (2019–2022) – Excel Dashboard
Project Overview

This project analyzes disability prevalence among adult females in the United States from 2019–2022 using data from the CDC’s Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset. The goal was to identify state-level and yearly trends in disability rates and highlight possible health equity concerns.
Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and structured the dataset, built PivotTables and PivotCharts, and designed an interactive dashboard to visualize patterns over time.
This project demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization skills that are valuable for public health, data analytics, and healthcare research roles.

Tools & Techniques

Microsoft Excel – data cleaning, PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers
AI (ChatGPT) – guided data organization and analytical workflow
Data Visualization – line graphs, bar charts, and filters for interactivity
Data Source: CDC Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)

Dataset Information

Years Covered: 2019–2022
Indicator: Percent of adult females with any disability
Variables Used: Indicator, Group, Group Value, Year, Location, Data Value
Total Rows (after filtering): ~5,000

Process Summary

Data Import: Downloaded and opened CDC dataset in Excel.
Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns, renamed headers, and formatted numerical values.
Filtering: Focused exclusively on the “Adult females with any disability” indicator.
PivotTables: Summarized data by State (Rows) and Year (2019–2022) (Columns) with average disability rates.
Visualization: Added bar and line charts to visualize yearly changes.
Dashboard Design: Combined visual elements and slicers to build an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.

Key Insights

National increase in reported disability prevalence among adult females from 2019 to 2022.
Regional variation: Some states consistently report higher rates, possibly linked to healthcare access, socioeconomic status, or reporting differences.
Notable growth between 2020–2021 may reflect post-pandemic effects on physical and mental health.
